# OptifineSFTextures
a Slimefun Resource pack created by GentlemanCheesy and Apeiros (aka lytespeed or Hexa Gone)

**OPTIFINE IS REQUIRED!**

This pack is still a work in progress. Not all textures have been completed.

## Instructions:

- Make sure you have Java installed
- Download all these files into a folder
- Run the .jar file **(I did not code the generator, all credit for that goes to [@Mooy1](https://github.com/Mooy1))**
- Close the window once it prompts you
- Take the .zip and put it in your resourcepacks folder

Thanks to [@Mooy1](https://github.com/Mooy1) for the [Slimefun Texture Generator](https://github.com/Mooy1/SlimefunTextureGenerator)
